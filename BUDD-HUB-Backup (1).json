        "fullText": "Residents in parts of northwest Nigeria report unusual movement of armed groups following recent US military air strikes. The strikes targeted locations believed to serve as terrorist hideouts during the Christmas period.\nCommunity leaders say the attacks forced the groups to abandon fixed camps and split into smaller units. Many reportedly moved through forest routes and rural corridors to avoid detection.\nIn some affected areas, residents confirmed damage to farmland and nearby structures. A few civilians sustained injuries, increasing tension among local populations.\nTraditional rulers and security sources warn the relocation poses new risks. Armed groups entering unfamiliar communities often seek supplies, shelter, or recruits.\nSecurity agencies have increased patrols and surveillance across border towns and forest zones. Officials say coordinated operations are underway to block escape paths and prevent regrouping.\nAnalysts stress the need for stronger intelligence sharing and sustained pressure. Without follow up action, displaced groups often reorganize and resume attacks.",

        "fullText": "Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal side demonstrated their title credentials once again, securing a vital 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion at a packed Emirates Stadium. The win comes as a perfect response to Manchester City’s temporary climb to the top earlier in the day.\nThe Gunners took control early when Martin Ødegaard rifled a low, left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the 14th minute—his first goal of an injury-interrupted season. Arsenal's dominance was further rewarded shortly after half-time when a dangerous Declan Rice corner was inadvertently headed into his own net by Brighton's Georginio Rutter.\nDespite being in cruise control for much of the match, the home fans were left biting their nails after Diego Gómez pulled one back for the Seagulls in the 64th minute. It took a world-class, fingertip save from David Raya in the dying moments to deny Yankuba Minteh and ensure all three points stayed in North London. Arsenal now sits two points clear at the top as they prepare for a festive clash against Aston Villa.",

Captain Wilfred Ndidi doubled the lead early in the second half, followed by a brilliant strike from Ademola Lookman to make it 3-0 by the 70th minute.\nHowever, the game took a tense turn as Tunisia fought back with goals from Talbi and a late penalty from Abdi. Despite a frantic final ten minutes, Stanley Nwabali and the Nigerian defense held firm to claim all three points. Nigeria now advances to face Uganda in the Round of 16 on Tuesday.",
