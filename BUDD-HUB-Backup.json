        "fullText": "Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal side demonstrated their title credentials once again, securing a vital 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion at a packed Emirates Stadium. The win comes as a perfect response to Manchester City’s temporary climb to the top earlier in the day.\nThe Gunners took control early when Martin Ødegaard rifled a low, left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the 14th minute—his first goal of an injury-interrupted season. Arsenal's dominance was further rewarded shortly after half-time when a dangerous Declan Rice corner was inadvertently headed into his own net by Brighton's Georginio Rutter.\nDespite being in cruise control for much of the match, the home fans were left biting their nails after Diego Gómez pulled one back for the Seagulls in the 64th minute. It took a world-class, fingertip save from David Raya in the dying moments to deny Yankuba Minteh and ensure all three points stayed in North London. Arsenal now sits two points clear at the top as they prepare for a festive clash against Aston Villa.",

Captain Wilfred Ndidi doubled the lead early in the second half, followed by a brilliant strike from Ademola Lookman to make it 3-0 by the 70th minute.\nHowever, the game took a tense turn as Tunisia fought back with goals from Talbi and a late penalty from Abdi. Despite a frantic final ten minutes, Stanley Nwabali and the Nigerian defense held firm to claim all three points. Nigeria now advances to face Uganda in the Round of 16 on Tuesday.",
