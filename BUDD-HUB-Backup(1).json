        "fullText": "The football world gathered in Dubai this Sunday for the 16th edition of the Globe Soccer Awards, where the industry's top performers of the past year were officially recognized. Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembele took home the prestigious Best Men's Player award, beating out stiff competition from the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Lamine Yamal. However, Yamal did not leave empty-handed, as the Barcelona starlet was named Best Forward.\nCristiano Ronaldo continued his legacy of success in the region, securing the Best Middle East Player award for his performances with Al Nassr. It was also a massive night for PSG, who were named Best Men's Club, while their manager Luis Enrique took home Best Coach and Luis Campos was honored as Best Sporting Director. Other notable wins included Barcelona Women being named Best Women's Club, Vitinha winning Best Midfielder, and Desire Doue being recognized as the Best Emerging Player. The ceremony, founded by Jorge Mendes—who once again won Best Agent—remains one of the sport's premier global galas.",

The win comes as a perfect response to Manchester City’s temporary climb to the top earlier in the day.\nThe Gunners took control early when Martin Ødegaard rifled a low, left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the 14th minute—his first goal of an injury-interrupted season. Arsenal's dominance was further rewarded shortly after half-time when a dangerous Declan Rice corner was inadvertently headed into his own net by Brighton's Georginio Rutter.\nDespite being in cruise control for much of the match, the home fans were left biting their nails after Diego Gómez pulled one back for the Seagulls in the 64th minute. It took a world-class, fingertip save from David Raya in the dying moments to deny Yankuba Minteh and ensure all three points stayed in North London. Arsenal now sits two points clear at the top as they prepare for a festive clash against Aston Villa.",
